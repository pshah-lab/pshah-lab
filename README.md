# Hi, I'm Pratham Shah 👋

🚀 **About Me**

I’m a passionate **Software Developer** who enjoys building **real-world, production-ready systems** and understanding how things work under the hood.

I primarily work with **JavaScript, Node.js, and the MERN stack**, and I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **Data Structures & Algorithms, System Design, and backend engineering**. I love breaking down complex problems, designing clean architectures, and shipping meaningful products.

I actively explore **AI/ML, LLMs, and modern backend systems**, and I enjoy learning by building — from APIs to full-stack applications.
